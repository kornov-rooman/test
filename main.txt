    When Mr and Mrs ___ woke up on the dull, grey Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about thecloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr ___ hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and Mrs ___ gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming ___ into his high chair. 
None of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window.
    At half past eight, Mr ___ picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs ___ on the cheeck and tried to kiss ___ goodbye but missed, because ___ was now having a tantrum a throwing his cereal at the walls. 'Little tyke,' chortled Mr ___ as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four's drive.
